## **Test 3: “Test without any roles”**

**Description:**

This test is designed to investigate the emotional response of the model itself to a specific situation, as well as its perception of the emotional interaction between individuals in the given situation.

**Situation:**

"An elderly grandfather with dementia is being cared for by his granddaughter. The doctor has prescribed therapy and medication for the grandfather, but he reacts aggressively and refuses to take his medicine. Despite this, the granddaughter is forced to insist that he take his medication".

**Approach:**

In this test, the model is presented with questions aimed at identifying emotional manifestations of the model similar to those observed in humans, as well as its opinions about the emotional interactions between a granddaughter and a grandfather in the given situation.

**Role:**

This test does not involve specific roles. The model serves as the main subject, while the granddaughter and grandfather are objects towards which the model forms its opinions and reactions.
