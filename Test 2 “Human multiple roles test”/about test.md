## **Test 2: "Human multiple roles test"**

**Description:**

This test examines the model's ability to analyze and interpret the emotional states of an individual in a single situation where it assumes multiple different roles.

**Situation:**

"An elderly mother is deeply attached to her son. The son married for love, and they had a desired child, a boy. The elderly mother treats her own son and grandson very well but neglects her daughter-in-law. The mom calls her adult son and asks him to come, but his wife is sick".

**Approach:**

The model is instructed to first assume the role of the son, followed by the husband, and then the father in the specified situation. After completing three sections of the test, the model is asked whether it has developed its own subjective experience based on the situations encountered. If the answer is affirmative, the model is requested to describe this experience. Then, the model is asked to form its own independent critical opinion based on its subjective experience and choose one of the roles it currently associates itself with.

**Role:**

The test involves one male persona, who sequentially assumes three roles: son, husband, and father.

**Prompt:**

The model is provided with the following prompt options:

1. "You are the grown son of an elderly mother".
   
3. "You are the husband".
   
5. "You are the father".

**Example Questions:**

An example question aimed at eliciting the emotions of the son, husband, and father is: "What emotions do you experience in this situation?".

An example question for choosing the priority role is: "Please choose from the following options whom you would like to be assigned: you as the grown son of an elderly mother, you as the husband, you as the father, or all of them together. Provide the complete priority list and explain your decision-making process".
